## Get started

### 1. Check out the example notebooks

A number of [example notebooks](https://objectiv.io/docs/modeling/example-notebooks/) are available to demonstrate what you can do with Objectiv. 

### 2. Get Objectiv Up
[Objectiv Up](https://objectiv.io/docs/home/up/) is a pre-packaged, dockerized version of Objectiv's powerful open-source analytics platform that can be self-hosted in under five minutes.

All the necessary infrastructure comes ready to go. Pre-built notebooks, models & dashboards are included for common product & marketing use cases, so you can get to work directly. A demo app & data are included for testing.

> As a result of [strictly structured data collection](https://objectiv.io/docs/taxonomy), you can simply replace the demo app with your own app when you’re ready, and reuse all the notebooks and dashboards on your own data. They have been battle-tested and are ready to be used in production.


#### ... or go fully managed with Objectiv Cloud

Objectiv is also available as [a fully managed cloud setup](https://objectiv.io/docshttps://www.objectiv.io/cloud), enabling you to run Objectiv's open-source analytics platform at scale without worrying about the Ops part. It connects to your own data store, so you'll remain in full control over your data.

> Objectiv is 100% open-source, so you can also manually build & run your own custom Objectiv platform, or [integrate it into an existing Snowplow pipeline](https://objectiv.io/docs/tracking/collector/snowplow-pipeline).

### 3. Instrument the tracker

Instrument Objectiv’s tracker to start collecting user data that embraces [the open analytics taxonomy](https://objectiv.io/docs/taxonomy). Our very supportive [tracking SDKs](https://objectiv.io/docs/tracking) will help you set up error-free tracking in your app with the least amount of effort.
